        "### **Python OOPs Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**  \n",
        "   - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that encapsulate data and behavior. It allows modular and reusable code by using principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is a class in OOP?**  \n",
        "   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is an object in OOP?**  \n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class. It contains data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**  \n",
        "   - **Abstraction** hides implementation details and exposes only the necessary functionalities.  \n",
        "   - **Encapsulation** restricts direct access to some data by binding data and methods together in a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Dunder (double underscore) methods, also called magic methods, are special methods with `__` before and after their names (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`). They enable operator overloading and object behavior customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**  \n",
        "   - Inheritance allows a child class to acquire properties and methods from a parent class, enabling code reusability. Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Animal:\n",
        "         def speak(self):\n",
        "             return \"Some sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "         def speak(self):\n",
        "             return \"Bark!\"\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**  \n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, typically via method overriding or method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Encapsulation is achieved using private (`__var`), protected (`_var`), and public variables. Private variables cannot be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is a constructor in Python?**  \n",
        "   - A constructor (`__init__` method) is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes object attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are class and static methods in Python?**  \n",
        "    - A **class method** (`@classmethod`) works with the class rather than an instance.  \n",
        "    - A **static method** (`@staticmethod`) is independent of class attributes and instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is method overloading in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Python does not support traditional method overloading but allows default arguments and variable-length arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**  \n",
        "    - Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**  \n",
        "    - The `@property` decorator is used to define getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes, allowing controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**  \n",
        "    - Polymorphism improves code flexibility and scalability by enabling a single interface to be used for different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**  \n",
        "    - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains at least one abstract method. It is defined using the `ABC` module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**  \n",
        "    - Code reusability, modularity, scalability, abstraction, and data security.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**  \n",
        "    - **Class variables** are shared across all instances of a class, while **instance variables** are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one class.\n",
        "      ```python\n",
        "      class A: pass\n",
        "      class B: pass\n",
        "      class C(A, B): pass\n",
        "      ```\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.**  \n",
        "    - `__str__` provides a readable string representation of an object, while `__repr__` provides an unambiguous representation for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**  \n",
        "    - `super()` allows a subclass to access methods from its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**  \n",
        "    - The `__del__` method is called when an object is destroyed to perform cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**  \n",
        "    - `@staticmethod` does not access class attributes, while `@classmethod` works with the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**  \n",
        "    - Inherited methods can be overridden to provide different behaviors in derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**  \n",
        "    - Method chaining allows calling multiple methods sequentially in a single statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**  \n",
        "    - The `__call__` method allows an object to be used as a function.\n",
